# Laravel Microservices Queue Management

This project aims to demonstrate how to manage queues in a microservices architecture using Laravel's built-in queue system.

## Introduction

Microservices architecture is a design pattern where an application is composed of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with other services through APIs.

One common challenge in microservices architecture is managing asynchronous communication between services. Queues provide a reliable way to handle this communication by decoupling the sending and processing of messages.

In this project, we'll explore how to set up and manage queues in a Laravel-based microservices architecture.

## Features

- **Service-oriented architecture:** The application is divided into multiple services, each responsible for a specific task.
- **Queue management:** Utilizes Laravel's queue system to handle asynchronous communication between services.
- **Message broker:** Uses a message broker like Redis or RabbitMQ to store and dispatch messages between services.
- **Fault tolerance:** Implements retry and failure handling mechanisms to ensure message processing reliability.
- **Monitoring and logging:** Integrates tools for monitoring queue performance and logging errors for debugging.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmrashed/laravel-microservices-queue-management.git
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
    cd laravel-microservices-queue-management
    composer install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Copy the .env.example file to .env and configure the necessary environment variables such as database connection details, queue driver, and message broker settings.

4. Run migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
5. Start the Laravel queues worker:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

6. Start each microservice:
Depending on your microservices architecture, start each service by navigating to its directory and running the appropriate command. Ensure that each service is configured to listen to the same message broker used by the main application.

7. Monitor queue performance:
Utilize Laravel's built-in queue monitoring tools or integrate third-party monitoring solutions to track queue performance and identify bottlenecks.
